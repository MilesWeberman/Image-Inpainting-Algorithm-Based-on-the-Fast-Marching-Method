# FMM image_inpainting

This repository contains the implementation of an image inpainting method using the Fast Marching Method. It is based on a 2006 paper by Telea which can be found in the root of the repository.

Abstract of the paper:
In this paper we provide an implementation of an image inpainting algorithm based on Alexandru Telea’s 2006 publication titled ”An Image Inpainting Technique Based on the Fast Marching Method” [1]. We will give
an overview of different approaches to image inpainting and the advantages and disadvantages of using the Fast Marching Method (FMM). We
will discuss our (Python) algorithm implementation and compare it with
existing implementations (such as the one in OpenCV). We will provide
numerical and visual comparisons between both algorithms’ performances.
